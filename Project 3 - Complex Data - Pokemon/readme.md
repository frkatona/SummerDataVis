# Week 2 - Complex Data - Pokemon

For use with the pokemon_data.csv dataset

## Assignment

**Surname** starts with:
A-J: Plot 1
K-L: Plot 2
M-Z: Plot 3

Depending on your assigned number, create a plot that conveys:

1) The number of Dragon-type pokemon in each "Generation"
2) Comparison of the average "HP", "Attack", and "Defense" of each unique "Type 1" type
3) The correlation (or lack of correlation) between "#" and "Speed"

## Rules

- No particular data management or plotting software is preferred, but consider readability and focus in your choices of color, font, labels, axis scales, etc.
- Include a short description/legend that highlights notable features if they exist
