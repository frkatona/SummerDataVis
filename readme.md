# Summer Data Vis Activity

## How it works

- Each week, you will be assigned a dataset
- Complete a figure including a figure legend using the dataset assigned to you
- The data complexity and plotting expectations will be increased over the weeks

### Project 1 - Basic plotting (covering general best practices)

Create an easy to read figure from the provided data.  Consider simplicity, palette, contrast, labels, fonts, sizes axis limits.  See the "Resources" folder for guidance.

### Project 2 - Focus (highlighting relevant story points within the figure)

Figures generally don't exist in a vacuum, and the narrative element that they reinforce or highlight should be easy to find. Consider the role the figure plays in the narrative to guide the eye to the *purpose* of the figure (role will be provided). Consider using contrast (or arrows/circles to be less subtle) to showcase and emphasize relevant information.

### Project 3 - Extracting data from more complex data sets (Pokémon csv)

Real data often comes with extraneous information that needs to be filtered out.  In this case, you will be provided with a csv file of Pokémon data.  You will need to filter out the relevant information and create a figure for your assignment.

### Project 4 - Working up data (normalization/correction, fitting, statistics)

Data often needs contextualized for readability.  This can mean normalizing so values can be interpreted as a fraction of a maximum, fitting a curve to make their relationship obvious, and honestly representing the variance of averaged values for repeat measurements.  You will be provided with a dataset that requires some of these considerations.

## Resources

See the "Resources" folder various example color palettes and plotting examples.  Note that none of these are endorsed, per se, but rather provided for developing a discussion.

The AnthonyColors.json palettes can be previewed by opening the PaletteVis.html file in a browser.
